Exercise 1: Inventory Management System


Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms:

Efficient data storage and retrieval are essential for managing large inventories because:

Speed: Operations like adding, updating, and deleting products should be fast to ensure smooth operation of the warehouse.

Scalability: The system should handle large volumes of data without significant performance degradation.

Organization: Proper organization of data enables quick searches and efficient management of the inventory.



Suitable Data Structures:

ArrayList: Provides fast access (O(1) for get operations) and easy iteration but has O(n) complexity for add and remove operations if resizing or shifting elements is necessary.

HashMap: Offers average-case O(1) time complexity for add, update, and delete operations, making it suitable for efficient inventory management where quick lookups are required.



Setup
creating a new Java project named InventoryManagementSystem.



Analysis:

Time Complexity Analysis

Add Product: O(1) on average, due to the nature of HashMap.
Update Product: O(1) on average, because updating an entry in HashMap involves a constant-time put operation.
Delete Product: O(1) on average, as removing an entry from HashMap is also a constant-time operation.
Get Product: O(1) on average, because HashMap provides constant-time access to values by key.


Optimization:

HashMap Efficiency: Using a HashMap ensures that all operations (add, update, delete, get) have an average-case time complexity of O(1). This is highly efficient for large datasets.
Handling Collisions: Ensure that the hash function used by the HashMap distributes the entries uniformly to avoid clustering, which can degrade performance.
Capacity and Load Factor: Set appropriate initial capacity and load factor for the HashMap to minimize resizing operations.

Hence,
Using a HashMap in the inventory management system provides efficient data storage and retrieval, with constant time complexity for essential operations. This ensures the system can handle large inventories effectively.
